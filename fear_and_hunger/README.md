## How to setup

Both the setup and the launch script assumes that you have Fear & Hunger installed in the default Steam path, if you installed it somewhere else or if you use the GOG or itch.io version modify the `FEAR_AND_HUNGER_PATH` variable in the scripts

Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/tranarchy/arm64-linux-games
cd arm64-linux-games/fear_and_hunger
```

Run the setup script

```
./setup.sh
```

Now you can launch Fear & Hunger with `fear-and-hunger`
